## Little bit about me

<!-- What do you enjoy developing? -->


<!-- A little bit about you? -->

I grew up in Bloomington, IL, and I have always had a passion for computers and design. With a bit of an IT background and a decent design background I decided to pursue web development! I currently reside in Michigan, and I am changing my focus to web development and UX/UI design. Feel free to contact me on either one of my social medias down below!
